# Stormed Out
This is a weird website. On it I write informational articles, as well as answer questions and prompts you submit. Send a prompt or question to storm.networks.info@gmail.com. You can also make a github account and submit a question and such in the issues tab, or discuss with other people in the disscustions tab. Enjoy!. 

Note: I give higher priority to issues than emails.
